	<h2>How to Ask Questions</h2>
	<article>
		<h3>No Framework For A Fundamental Skill?</h3>
		<p>
			Every day we ask questions. Many of these questions involve general everyday knowledge so you tend to receive answers quickly and easily. But what happens when you need to ask questions that require context or specific knowledge, like programming questions?
		</p>
			A typical algorithm for programmers when they need to find answers is to Google their questions. After all, your question is probably one that's been answered before. However, you'll find that often times, simple questions aren't phrased to optimize your chance of receiving a helpful answer. It is important to present your question to optimize for a helpful answer.

			There isn't one universal way of askign questions but here are some generally accepted best practices. Let's explore a few below.

		<h3>Framing Your Question</h3>
		<p>
			When asking a question, it is important to orient your audience by providing the scope and context of your question. If it is a general question, try giving a specific example. If it is a specific question, provide just enough information and context to understand your question. Use screenshots, screencasts, your actual code, steps to recreate your issue but be careful. It is easy to provide irrelevant information that throw off your helpers.

		<h3>Not Sure How To Ask A Question? Describe It.</h3>
		<p>
			Often as beginners, we are unsure about how to ask a question. We can seem like we are beating around the bush. This is of course unintentional. One reason this happens is that as beginners, we might not have the vocabulary to ask direct questions. If this is the case, spend time describing your question. It helps to use analogies or showing how you arrived at your question. What actions caused you to ask this question? What were you researching? Being accurate and concise matters even more when you don't know how to ask a question but be generous in using examples and different methods of presenting your question to increase your chances of receiving a helpful response.
