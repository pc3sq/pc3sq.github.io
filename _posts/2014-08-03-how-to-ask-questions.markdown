		<h3>Not Sure How To Ask A Question? Describe It.</h3>
		<p>
			Often as beginners, we are unsure about how to ask a question. We can seem like we are beating around the bush. This is of course unintentional. One reason this happens is that as beginners, we might not have the vocabulary to ask direct questions. If this is the case, spend time describing your question. It helps to use analogies or showing how you arrived at your question. What actions caused you to ask this question? What were you researching? Being accurate and concise matters even more when you don't know how to ask a question but be generous in using examples and different methods of presenting your question to increase your chances of receiving a helpful response.
